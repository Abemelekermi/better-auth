## About the Project

Better Auth is framework-agnostic authentication (and authorization) library for TypeScript. It provides a comprehensive set of features out of the box and includes a plugin ecosystem that simplifies adding advanced functionalities with minimal code in short amount of time. Whether you need 2FA, multi-tenant support, or other complex features. It lets you focus on building your actual application instead of reinventing the wheel. 

### Why Better Auth

Authentication in the TypeScript ecosystem is a half-solved problem. Other open-source libraries often requires a lot of additional code for anything beyond basic authentication. Rather than just pushing third-party services as the solution, I believe we can do better as a communityâ€”hence, Better Auth.

### Goals
****

- **Be Comprehensive**: save users from reinventing the wheel as much as possible.
- **Prioritize Best Practices**: provide best practices rather than overwhelming configuration options.
- **Framework Agnostic**: Support most frameworks and avoid framework specific features and solutions if possible.
- **Consistency**: Provide a consistent and predictable API across all platforms
- **Type Safety**: Value type-safety and embrace typescript magic when necessary.

### Non-Goals
****

- **JWT-Based Authentication**: We wonâ€™t support JWT-based auth unless provided by a third-party plugin.
- **Extensive Customization**: Our focus is on giving you opinionated, best-practice defaults, rather than enabling deep customization.
