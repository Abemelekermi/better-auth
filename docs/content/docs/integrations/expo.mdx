description: Learn how to use Better Auth with Expo.

Expo is a popular framework for building cross-platform apps with React Native. Better Auth supports both Expo native and web apps.

## Installation

<Steps>
    <Step>
        ## Configure A Better Auth Backend
        Before using Better Auth with Expo, make sure you have a Better Auth backend set up. You can either use a separate server or leverage Expo's new [API Routes](https://docs.expo.dev/router/reference/api-routes) feature to host your Better Auth instance.

        To get started, check out our [installation](/docs/installation) guide for setting up Better Auth on your server.
    </Step>
    <Step>
        ## Install Better Auth and Expo Plugin

        With your server up and running, install both Better Auth and the Expo plugin in your Expo project.

        ```package-install
        better-auth @better-auth/expo
        ```
    </Step>
    <Step>
        ## Initialize Better Auth Client
        
        To initialize Better Auth in your Expo app, you need to call `createAuthClient` with the base url of your Better Auth backend. Make sure to import the client from `/react`.

        ```ts title="src/auth-client.ts"
        import { createAuthClient } from 'better-auth/react';

        const authClient = createAuthClient({
            basURL: 'http://localhost:8081', /* base url of your Better Auth backend. */
        });
        ```
        <Callout>
         Be sure to include the full URL, including the path, if you've changed the default path from `/api/auth`.
        </Callout>
    </Step>
    <Step>
        ## Configure Metro Bundler

        To resolve better auth exports you'll need to enable `unstable_enablePackageExports` in your metro config. 

        ```js title="metro.config.js"
        const { getDefaultConfig } = require("expo/metro-config");

        const config = getDefaultConfig(__dirname)

        config.resolver.unstable_enablePackageExports = true; // [!code highlight]

        module.exports = config;
        ```
    </Step>
</Steps>
